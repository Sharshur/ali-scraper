# AliScraper Project Review
Empowering WooCommerce Affiliate Link Sites with Accurate Pricing



Introduction:

The AliScraper project was developed to address a common challenge faced by WooCommerce (A Wordpress plugin) site owners who rely on affiliate links to sell products sourced from suppliers like AliExpress. The project aimed to provide an automated solution for keeping the prices and stock information of products up-to-date on affiliate websites, ensuring a seamless and accurate shopping experience for customers.

Problem Statement:

The core issue that AliScraper aimed to resolve was the inconsistency in product data between affiliate websites and the actual product listings on AliExpress. When the price or stock availability of a product changed on AliExpress, the affiliate websites failed to reflect these updates. This discrepancy could potentially frustrate customers, as they might encounter product pages with incorrect pricing or even discover that the product was out of stock altogether upon clicking the affiliate link.


Solution Overview:

AliScraper proposed a systematic solution to this problem by following a set of key steps:

Data Extraction: The first step involved extracting product data from the customer's WooCommerce site and converting it into a CSV file. This data served as the baseline for price and stock information.

Web Scraping: The project utilized web scraping techniques to access the actual product pages on AliExpress. This involved collecting up-to-date pricing and stock availability information for each product listed in the CSV file.

CSV File Update: Following the successful scraping process, a corrected CSV file was generated, which now contained accurate pricing and stock data, reflecting the current status on AliExpress.

Data Upload: The final step involved uploading the corrected CSV file back to the customer's WooCommerce site, ensuring that the product listings were now accurate.

Benefits and Growth:

This script operated externally to the customerâ€™s site, providing flexibility and autonomy.
It allowed for easy adjustments and updates, making it a scalable solution.
AliScraper was initially developed as a custom request for a single customer, but after the delivery I quickly got referrals to additional potential clients.
